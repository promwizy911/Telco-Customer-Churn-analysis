Telco Customer Churn Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a data-driven understanding of customer churn. Specifically, the project aims to:

Identify Risk Factors: Determine which customer attributes (e.g., contract type, internet service, or tenure) are the strongest predictors of churn.

Predictive Modeling: Build a model to accurately identify high-risk customers before they leave, allowing for proactive intervention.

Business Insights: Provide actionable recommendations for the marketing and customer success teams, such as identifying which service bundles or payment methods improve customer loyalty.
